# Sindhupalchok Earthquake Damage Analysis

## Project Overview

The Sindhupalchok Earthquake Damage Analysis project is a comprehensive machine learning endeavor aimed at understanding the patterns of destruction caused by the Gorkha earthquake in the Sindhupalchok district of Nepal. Utilizing a decision tree classification model, this project identifies the building characteristics that most significantly contributed to the structural damage during the earthquake. The insights garnered from this analysis are not only pivotal for retrospective understanding but also for enhancing future disaster preparedness and structural resilience.

## Repository Contents

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and model development.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ungest/Building-Damage-Classifier-Nepal.git
   cd Building-Damage-Classifier-Nepal
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the analysis:

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in an environment that supports `.ipynb` files (like JupyterLab or VSCode).
3. Execute the cells in sequence to replicate the analysis, model training, and evaluation.
